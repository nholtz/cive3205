# CIVE 3205 Notebooks

This contains some *experimental* notebooks to support the teaching
of course **CIVE 3205: Design of Structural Steel Components** at
Carleton University.

**Caution** :bangbang: These notebooks have not been
well debugged and may not be fit for purpose.
Use at your own risk :exclamation:
Under no circumstances should these be used to support real engineering
design.

Most of the notebooks require a library in the companion 'ca-steel-design'
repository.  You will likely have to clone that one as well, and modify
the scripts `run_notebook.sh` (for Linux) or `run-notebook.cmd` (for Windows)
in order to ensure the library can be imported properly.

It is suggested that you start your notebook server in this directory,
by executing the appropriate script.

Good luck.
